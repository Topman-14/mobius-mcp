# Roadmap

mobius-mcp started as a log bridge. The direction is a **browser runtime service**: a server an agent can command, not just read from — synchronous tools answer questions about existing state, asynchronous ones (backed by a shared job system) initiate work that takes time.

Nothing here is published yet, so none of this is versioned (`v1`/`v2`/...) — it's tracked as build stages instead. Version numbers start once something actually ships. See [PROJECT.md](./PROJECT.md) for the architecture this builds toward.

**npm client status: paused.** `mobius-client` works at its current baseline (console/error/network capture via `startMobiusStream()`), but isn't getting further investment right now — framework/bundler nuances (Vite/webpack HMR re-invoking the patch, Next.js SSR/RSC boundary, React StrictMode double-invoke) make it a deeper problem than the extension warrants prioritizing today. The extension is where new capability work lands; the npm client will catch up once that's mature.

## Stage A — per-tab identity, memory bounds, opt-in capture (done)

- Per-tab identity: one background worker multiplexes many tabs over one WebSocket, but each tab is its own logical client (`hello`/`bye` per tab, not per browser install)
- Per-tab in-memory ring buffers (not one global buffer) with a shared cross-tab `seq` counter, field-length truncation, disconnect grace period before purge
- Tool disambiguation: `tabId` param on all query tools, auto-resolved when only one tab is connected, `set_active_tab` for session-scoped default, explicit error (not silent guessing) when multiple tabs are connected and unspecified
- Extension capture is opt-in per tab: a popup toggle (click the icon) is the single opt-in; an options page lets hostname/port rules auto-enable specific dev servers without a manual click. Nothing is captured by default.

## Stage B — command infrastructure (done)

The browser client becomes a remote-debugging target (Chrome DevTools ⇄ Chrome), not just a one-way log producer.

- Message envelope gains `kind: "command"` / `"ack"` variants with correlation IDs
- `ClientInfo`/`hello` gains `capabilities` (`["cdp"]` for the extension, `[]` for the npm client) — commands a client can't support fail clearly instead of hanging
- Job system (`startJob`/`get_job_status`/`get_job_result`/`cancel_job`) — the shared primitive every async capability after this stage is built on
- Browser-control tools needing no CDP: `navigate_to`, `list_tabs`, `switch_tab`, `reload_tab`

## Stage C — debug sessions (done)

The highest-leverage capability beyond raw ingestion, and cheap once the job system exists — aggregates event streams into one time-ordered timeline instead of forcing the agent to correlate separate snapshots itself.

- `start_debug_session({ tabId, capture: [...] })` / `end_debug_session(sessionId)` → ordered timeline (console, network, navigation, DOM mutations); single-tab sessions only for now
- New always-on `navigation` event type; `dom.mutation` event type, captured only during a session that requests it (mutation observers are noisy/expensive to run always-on)
- `wait_for_*` tools built on the same infrastructure: `wait_for_console_error`, `wait_for_navigation`, `wait_for_request` (server-side, event-driven), `wait_for_element` (in-page polling via a command)

## Stage D — CDP-backed capture (extension-only) (done)

Everything here requires `chrome.debugger` (Chrome DevTools Protocol) — gated by the `capabilities` check from Stage B, unavailable to npm-client-only tabs. Attaching shows Chrome's "being debugged" banner on the tab; the debugger attaches once per tab (not per call) and stays attached while the tab is capture-enabled.

- Screenshots: `take_screenshot`, `capture_full_page`, `capture_element`
- DOM/accessibility: `capture_dom`, `capture_accessibility_tree`
- Performance: `start_cpu_profile`, `start_memory_profile` — job-based, capped at 60s and best-effort beyond ~25-30s since an idle MV3 background service worker can be terminated by Chrome mid-profile
- Runtime evaluation: `evaluate_js` — fully open, no read-only enforcement (local-first threat model: it's the dev's own browser and app)
- Network detail: `get_response_body` (URL-keyed, best-effort — only requests seen via CDP's `Network.responseReceived` while attached), `export_har` (works from stored events for either client, never includes bodies)

## Beyond this plan

- Framework introspection: React/Redux/Zustand state, storage inspection (cookies/localStorage/IndexedDB), source map resolution, Next.js overlay/Vite HMR errors
- Multi-tab debug sessions
- npm client hardening (once unpaused): HMR-safe re-invocation guard, documented SSR/client-only usage, StrictMode-safe teardown
