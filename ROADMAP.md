# Roadmap

mobius-mcp started as a log bridge. The direction is a **browser runtime service**: a server an agent can command, not just read from — synchronous tools answer questions about existing state, asynchronous ones (backed by a shared job system) initiate work that takes time.

Nothing here is published yet, so none of this is versioned (`v1`/`v2`/...) — it's tracked as build stages instead. Version numbers start once something actually ships. See [PROJECT.md](./PROJECT.md) for the architecture this builds toward.

**npm client status: paused.** `mobius-client` works at its current baseline (console/error/network capture via `startMobiusStream()`), but isn't getting further investment right now — framework/bundler nuances (Vite/webpack HMR re-invoking the patch, Next.js SSR/RSC boundary, React StrictMode double-invoke) make it a deeper problem than the extension warrants prioritizing today. The extension is where new capability work lands; the npm client will catch up once that's mature.

## Stage A — per-tab identity, memory bounds, opt-in capture (done)

- Per-tab identity: one background worker multiplexes many tabs over one WebSocket, but each tab is its own logical client (`hello`/`bye` per tab, not per browser install)
- Per-tab in-memory ring buffers (not one global buffer) with a shared cross-tab `seq` counter, field-length truncation, disconnect grace period before purge
- Tool disambiguation: `tabId` param on all query tools, auto-resolved when only one tab is connected, `set_active_tab` for session-scoped default, explicit error (not silent guessing) when multiple tabs are connected and unspecified
- Extension capture is opt-in per tab: a popup toggle (click the icon) is the single opt-in; an options page lets hostname/port rules auto-enable specific dev servers without a manual click. Nothing is captured by default.

## Stage B — command infrastructure (done)

The browser client becomes a remote-debugging target (Chrome DevTools ⇄ Chrome), not just a one-way log producer.

- Message envelope gains `kind: "command"` / `"ack"` variants with correlation IDs
- `ClientInfo`/`hello` gains `capabilities` (`["cdp"]` for the extension, `[]` for the npm client) — commands a client can't support fail clearly instead of hanging
- Job system (`startJob`/`get_job_status`/`get_job_result`/`cancel_job`) — the shared primitive every async capability after this stage is built on
- Browser-control tools needing no CDP: `navigate_to`, `list_tabs`, `switch_tab`, `reload_tab`

## Stage C — debug sessions (done)

The highest-leverage capability beyond raw ingestion, and cheap once the job system exists — aggregates event streams into one time-ordered timeline instead of forcing the agent to correlate separate snapshots itself.

- `start_debug_session({ tabId, capture: [...] })` / `end_debug_session(sessionId)` → ordered timeline (console, network, navigation, DOM mutations); single-tab sessions only for now
- New always-on `navigation` event type; `dom.mutation` event type, captured only during a session that requests it (mutation observers are noisy/expensive to run always-on)
- `wait_for_*` tools built on the same infrastructure: `wait_for_console_error`, `wait_for_navigation`, `wait_for_request` (server-side, event-driven), `wait_for_element` (in-page polling via a command)

## Stage D — CDP-backed capture (extension-only) (done)

Everything here requires `chrome.debugger` (Chrome DevTools Protocol) — gated by the `capabilities` check from Stage B, unavailable to npm-client-only tabs. Attaching shows Chrome's "being debugged" banner on the tab; the debugger attaches once per tab (not per call) and stays attached while the tab is capture-enabled.

- Screenshots: `take_screenshot`, `capture_full_page`, `capture_element`
- DOM/accessibility: `capture_dom`, `capture_accessibility_tree`
- Performance: `start_cpu_profile`, `start_memory_profile` — job-based, capped at 60s and best-effort beyond ~25-30s since an idle MV3 background service worker can be terminated by Chrome mid-profile
- Runtime evaluation: `evaluate_js` — fully open, no read-only enforcement (local-first threat model: it's the dev's own browser and app)
- Network detail: `get_response_body` (URL-keyed, best-effort — only requests seen via CDP's `Network.responseReceived` while attached), `export_har` (works from stored events for either client, never includes bodies)

## Beyond this plan

- Framework introspection: React/Redux/Zustand state, storage inspection (cookies/localStorage/IndexedDB), source map resolution, Next.js overlay/Vite HMR errors
- Multi-tab debug sessions
- **Richer event context.** Today's console/error/network events are captured close to raw — enough to see *what* happened, not always enough to see *why* without a follow-up round trip (`evaluate_js`, `get_response_body`) the agent has to know to make.
  - Console/errors: attach a resolved stack trace (source-mapped where a map is available) instead of just `message`, and group related entries — e.g. a `console.error` immediately followed by an `unhandledrejection` from the same call, or repeated identical logs collapsed with a count instead of N separate feed entries
  - Network: pair request and response detail on one event instead of requiring a separate `get_response_body` call — response headers, a size-capped body preview, and the initiator (which script/line triggered the request) inline; surface CORS/mixed-content/blocked-request failures as a distinct reason instead of `status: undefined`
  - Keep this opt-in/tunable via capture settings — richer payloads mean more captured data (bigger privacy footprint, same as the durable-persistence question below) and more noise on busy pages, so it shouldn't be forced on by default
- npm client hardening (once unpaused): HMR-safe re-invocation guard, documented SSR/client-only usage, StrictMode-safe teardown
- **Durable log persistence.** Two separate ephemeral stores today, both lossy: the MCP server's `EventStore` (`apps/mcp-server/src/store.ts`) is a pure in-memory ring buffer, capped at 1000 events/tab, wiped on server restart, buffer deleted 5 minutes after a client disconnects; the extension's `chrome.storage.session`-backed live state (`apps/browser-extension/src/lib/live-state.ts`) survives service-worker idle-restarts but is wiped on extension reload/disable/browser close, and deliberately clears a tab's feed on `chrome.tabs.onRemoved`.
  - Extension: back the durable log with **IndexedDB**, not `chrome.storage.local` — `storage.local` JSON-serializes the whole value per key per write (O(n) rewrite as an array grows), a poor fit for high-frequency small appends; IndexedDB gives real indexes (`seq` autoincrement PK, index on `clientId`, index on `type`), is async/off-thread, and has a disk-based quota. Keep `chrome.storage.session` as-is for the popup's live counters/feed (small, capped, fast render path) — IndexedDB is the backing store for history/cursor queries, not what re-renders the UI. Batch writes (flush every ~250ms or 50 events per transaction, not one `put()` per event), prune via an `IDBKeyRange` delete on a timestamp index in the same flush cycle. Redaction still happens upstream in `capture-core` before an event leaves the page — the persistence layer doesn't need its own pass.
  - Server: **SQLite (WAL mode)** as a write-behind archive, keeping the in-memory ring buffer as the hot path for `get_recent_*`/`get_logs_since` (no added latency for recent queries) and SQLite as the fallback once a cursor predates what's in memory / after a restart.
  - Open questions before implementing: retention window, and whether persistence is opt-in (captured logs can contain request bodies/headers even with redaction on, so durable-by-default has a bigger privacy footprint than today's wipe-on-restart behavior).
